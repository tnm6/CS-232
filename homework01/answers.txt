1. 1024 words of RAM. The number of bytes per RAM isn't defined, but if it is
  the usual 2 bytes per word, then 2048 bytes of RAM.
2. Three "normal" registers (reg0â€“2) and one program counter (pc).
3. JLZ takes two parameters: the register number <reg> and the destination
  <dest>. If the <reg> is less than zero, then jump program counter to <dest>.
4. In _run_program(), after any optional debug statements. So when calling
  start() for the CPU, run() calls _run_program(), which immediately after
  checking debug options, will check for an interrupt.
5. S shows memory from a given start point to a given end point.
6. ! toggles debugging on or off during startup.
7. Assembly language files can contain both comments and blank lines.
8. _write_program() in main.py writes bytes into memory.
9. Yes, they assume they are loaded into certain locations in memory.
